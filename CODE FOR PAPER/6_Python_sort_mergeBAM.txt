### 6. Sort peaks, find overlap with TSS (MARKED BY H3K4me3 peaks)

# a. Sort peaks

cd combined

sortBed -i combined_H3K4me1_peaks.txt > 1-sorted_H3K4me1_peaks.txt
sortBed -i combined_H3K4me3_peaks.txt > 1-sorted_H3K4me3_peaks.txt
sortBed -i combined_H3K27ac_peaks.txt > 1-sorted_H3K27ac_peaks.txt
sortBed -i combined_H3K27me3_peaks.txt > 1-sorted_H3K27me3_peaks.txt


# b. generate merged BAM of all H3K4me3 regions across samples to identify rough promoter regions

mergeBED -i 1-sorted_H3K4me3_peaks.txt > 2-merged_H3K4me3_peaks.txt

# c. find overlap with TSS( MARKED BY merged H3K4me3 peaks)
